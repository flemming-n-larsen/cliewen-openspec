# Project configuration

Project settings live in `.cliewen-openspec/config.yaml`. New installations include these defaults. Existing config files can omit these sections and receive the same defaults.

```yaml
ac:
  padding: 3
  capabilities: {}
testing:
  placement: per-task
```

## Acceptance criterion IDs

An ID consists of an uppercase prefix, a hyphen, and a positive sequence number. Register a prefix for each capability before allocating IDs:

```yaml
ac:
  padding: 3
  capabilities:
    csv-export: EXP
    account-management: ACC
    support: SUP
```

Capability names match their directories under `openspec/specs/` or the change's `specs/`. A new capability can be registered before its spec directory exists. There is no global prefix or automatic prefix selection.

Choose a short, recognizable capability or domain name with your team. `EXPORT` and `EXP` are equally valid; Cliewen does not infer either from the change title. Reuse the chosen prefix for that capability across changes. The prefix must start with an uppercase letter and contain only uppercase letters and digits.

```sh
cliewen-openspec ac next --capability csv-export  # EXP-001 initially
cliewen-openspec ac next --capability support     # SUP-001 initially
cliewen-openspec ac next EXP                      # Same registered sequence as csv-export
```

`padding` is the minimum number of digits, from 1 to 12. For example, 1 produces `EXP-1`, 3 produces `EXP-001`, and 4 produces `EXP-0001`. Numbers grow beyond the minimum width without truncation. The separator is always a hyphen; arbitrary ID templates are not supported.

Each capability owns one numeric sequence. The allocator consults the committed `.cliewen-openspec/ac-registry.json` and existing OpenSpec Markdown, including active and archived changes. It never reclaims allocated numbers. Changing padding continues the same sequence and does not rewrite existing IDs. Commit the registry together with config and specs. Parallel branches still need collision resolution; this allocator supports sequential work rather than distributed allocation.

### Renaming a prefix

Use the command rather than editing an established mapping directly:

```sh
cliewen-openspec ac rename-prefix csv-export EXPORT
cliewen-openspec ac next --capability csv-export
```

If the highest allocated number was `EXP-017`, the next ID is `EXPORT-018`. Existing scenarios and tests keep their `EXP-...` references. The command updates config and registry in one recoverable transaction, preserving YAML comments. Config and registry mismatches block allocation and are reported by `check`, including when evidence is disabled. Restore the registered prefix in config before running the rename command if you edited it manually.

Current and historical prefixes remain reserved to their original capability, even if its config mapping is removed. Allocation using a retired prefix is rejected with guidance to use the current capability. Previously used prefixes cannot be reassigned, including renaming back to a historical prefix. The command also rejects target prefixes already appearing in OpenSpec documents.

The registry records each capability's current prefix, previous prefixes, and highest allocated number. Existing flat alpha registries are adopted on the next allocation or rename: first map each used prefix to its original capability. Unmapped legacy counters remain reserved; they are never silently discarded or assigned to new capabilities. `check` validates this state without writing it. Removing the registry loses allocation history, so retain it in version control.

The earlier experimental `ac.prefix` setting is no longer supported. Replace it with `ac.capabilities` before using this version. Existing bracketed IDs remain valid evidence references regardless of prefix history.

## Test placement

`testing.placement` controls the schema's planning and implementation guidance:

- `per-task` (default): Each implementation task includes its relevant tests, a test command, and a completion check. Implement a small slice, run its tests, fix failures, and then continue to the next task. Documentation-only tasks can use an appropriate validation check. This provides fast feedback throughout implementation.
- `end-of-change`: Plan tests in a final verification section, with explicit links to the implementation tasks they cover.

Both modes retain final regression testing and revision-bound evidence collection. Per-task test runs provide immediate feedback; the evidence adapter records results for the final committed inputs. Disabling evidence does not disable ordinary task-level testing.

This setting is agent guidance supplied by the installed schema and task template. The CLI does not parse tasks to enforce test ordering, and configuration changes do not rewrite existing task lists. Ask the agent to revise an existing plan when changing this setting.

## Existing alpha installations

The updated schema and templates are installed by a fresh `init`. This alpha does not implement `update`; adding settings to an older installation alone does not replace its schema instructions. Use a fresh pilot to evaluate the updated workflow. Preserve any existing pilot's artifacts and results.
